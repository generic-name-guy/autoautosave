Autosave on certain events:
- all monsters are killed.
- all items are found.
- a secret is found.
- armor type changed.
- health increased more than 25.
- Radsuit is picked up.
- Monster with health >= 2000 is killed.
- 5 minutes have passed.
- BFG is picked up.
- Key or skull is picked up.
- Invulnerability is picked up.

Todo:
- universal boss kill
  ideas:
  spot boss like monster scouter, register, check tid - not robust, needs mouselook
- universal key pickup
- universal powerup pickup?

Autosave will not happen if:
- previous auto autosave was made in 30 seconds.
- player has less than 25 health.

Plans:
- make autosave on every event optional
- make time periods configurable
- make health limit corfigurable
- more events (what?)
- other games and mods
